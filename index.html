A native of Southern California, he received most of his formal education in the Atlantic states.  Living in and around New York City, he earned his living as a teacher, and as an institutional investor. The early onslaught of the derivatives “revolution” drove him to Washington State, to a then-stable pension investment firm, and in 2003 he forwent finance to write full-time. The same year marked the advent of Golden Handcuffs Review, which he continues to edit. His informal education began in the Lower East Side of “The City,” when the artistic experiments in and around St. Mark’s Church in the Bowery flourished. He is eternally grateful to the English Department at Harvard University for making the formal study of academic literature repugnant to him.</p>

              <h4>PHIL SHOENFELT</h4>
              <p>Phil Shoenfelt is an English musician, poet and novelist who has lived in Prague since

He is a veteran of the UK and New York punk and post-punk scenes, and during the early

1980’s was frontman for the New York band Khmer Rouge. To date he has had a total of 15

CDs released on various independent record labels, as well as several Eps and singles. In

addition to his music, Phil has had four books published: Junkie Love; The Green

Hotel;Stripped – Book One; and Magdalena – Books One & Two (a collaboration with

Kateřina Piňosová). Junkie Love was first published in Czech translation asFeťácká Láska,

and has become something of a cult book for Czech readers. The book was published for the

first time in English by Twisted Spoon Press, and went on to win a Firecracker Alternative

Book Award (NYC, 2002). At present, Phil is working on a trilogy of books

called Stripped, set in late 70s/early 80s New York. Stripped is set against a backdrop of rock

clubs like CBGBs, and the violent, drug-infested streets of Alphabet City, where the narrator

lives with his striptease dancer wife. Sucked into a maelstrom of sex, heroin and bad

behaviour, he questions everything and ends up believing in nothing. It’s a long way down to

the bottom, and many bizarre and magical things happen en route. Phil’s writing has also

appeared in publications and collections such as Gargoyle, Prague Literary Review, The

Return of Král Majáles,Optimism, Hele, Blatt, The Outlaw Poetry Network, From A Terrace

In Prague, Erotika – Drogen und Sexualita, Apple Of The
<p>Phil Shoenfelt je britský hudebník, básník a romanopisec, který od roku 1995 žije v Praze. Je

veteránem britské a newyorské punkové a post-punkové scény a na počátku 80. let byl

frontmanem newyorské kapely Khmer Rouge. K dnešnímu datu mu vyšlo celkem 15 CD u

různých nezávislých nahrávacích labelů, stejně jako několik EP desek a singlů. Mimo svou

hudební tvorbu Phil publikoval také čtyři knihy: Junkie Love;The Green Hotel; Stripped –

Book One; aMagdalena – Books One & Two (ve spolupráci s Kateřinou Piňosovou). Junkie

Love nejprve vyšla v českém překladu jako Feťácká láska a mezi českými čtenáři se stala

jakousi kultovní knihou. V angličtině poprvé vyšla v nakladatelství Twisted Spoon Press a

záhy se dočkala ocenění Firecracker Alternative Book Award (New York, 2002).

V současnosti Phil pracuje na knižní trilogii s názvem Stripped, zasazené do New Yorku

konce 70. a začátku 80. let.Stripped se odehrává na pozadí rockových klubů jako CBGBs a

v násilím a drogami zamořených ulicích Alphabet City, kde vypravěč žije se svou manželkou,

striptýzovou tanečnicí. Vtahovaný maelstromem sexu, heroinu a zkaženého jednání, vypravěč

pochybuje o všem a nakonec neuvěří ničemu. Je to dlouhá cesta až na samé dno, během níž se

přihodí mnoho bizarních a magických událostí. Philova tvorba se také objevila v periodicích a

antologiích jako je Gargoyle, Prague Literary Review, The Return of Král

Majáles, Optimism,Hele, Blatt, The Outlaw Poetry Network, From A Terrace In

Prague, Erotika – Drogen und Sexualita, Apple Of The Eye, Morgana, Vlna a Vlak.</p>
